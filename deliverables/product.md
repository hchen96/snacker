# Team 16: Snacker


#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


We are planning to build an interactive web-portal that recommends snacks to users based on their own reviews and preferences. Currently, there is no application on the market that solves the everyday dilemma of the grocery shopper and snack lover, in that they cannot explore potential interesting snacks without actually purchasing them or getting casual feedback from friends. Some exemplary use cases include:

1. the user is standing at a grocery store, looking to make a purchase decision. They open the web through their mobile browser and look at reviews and recommendations for snacks they are looking to try;
2. The user just bought some new snacks and really liked them, so they decide to open our website to put in a review for that snack in hopes of getting recommendations of other snacks that are as good as the one they just bought;
3. the user is procrastinating and decides to browse through the personalized recommendation list on our web; and, to add snacks they like into their wishlist.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?


There are several target users which can be specified. The most notable user groups are the everyday snack shoppers, travellers, the snack producers and the snack distributors. Everyday,  snack shoppers can use our web app to keep track of their snacking habit and to get personalized recommendations for new snacks they may like. Being new to the region, travellers will be able to use the application to discover foreign snacks that target their taste buds. The snack producers can view the reviews on the website and modify their recipes or advertising in response. Similarly, the snack distributors can understand the snack market via the website and make target distributing decisions by running analytics on the website data. For example, snack distributors can increase supplies in areas that have higher demand of a certain product.
