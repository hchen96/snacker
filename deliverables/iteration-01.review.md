## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* When: October 10, 2018
* Where: In tutorial

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Individual thinking of ideas for project and voting. We decided that each team member should think about an idea, and explain it in a paragraph in a Google document (i.e. write the idea, usability, its impact, and problems that can arise). After that, we discussed the ideas and voted for one. This decision made us think of different ideas and the impact of products that would have been created, and opened our minds to various viewpoints.

* Creating a group chat and a folder on Google Drive for our documents during the first iteration. This idea was successful, because we had to discuss the scope and the implementation of our project, and it made it possible for us to discuss some urgent matters on the chat, while collaborating on our documents more easily (since we didn't have our Github repository already).


* Writing an “ideas” file. Since it’s difficult for our group to meet up in person, we decided to create a file where everybody wrote down some features of the product (snack recommender) that he/she thought of. This approach helped significantly, because people could argue in favour or against the features, and write possible solutions to problems others have found.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Trying to set up a meeting time outside of tutorials didn’t turn out so well. We seem not to be able to find the time that works for all of us, and whenever someone tries to initiate the physical meet up in the group chat, the group chat becomes silent.


* Two attempts to organize online group call didn’t turn out well. First of all, there is no time that would work for all members of the team, so there are always 1 or 2 members who can’t attend the online meeting. Second of all, some people who were supposed to join the online meeting weren’t showing up at the scheduled time due to various reasons. Lastly, communication through the online call turns out to be inefficient, when compared to each member individually editing the documents on Google drive and using messages on the group chat in case of any doubts.


#### Planned changes

* Assign responsibilities for each member of the team related to our repository, e.g. maintain issues on the repository, documentation, etc. With clearly stated responsibilities, we can organize better the development of our product.

 * Decide on an additional fixed time to meet every week, probably online, so that everyone can leave that time slot open when they do their planning.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Defined the scope and features of our project. This was the main task of this iteration, and we successfully came up with an idea, after brainstorming and exploration of other ideas. The artifact is the *project.md* file.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* FYFB (Fort York Food Bank) non-profit project was discarded. We spent some time scoping this project, talked to the instructor and the TA about our interest in this project, and then talked about it with a representative of the organization. We had some conflicts because the project they wanted us to do, wouldn’t suffice as a project for CSC301, and they didn’t have any other software for us to work on, so in the end, the group decided to pursue our own idea.

## Meeting Highlights


* Create the basis to work in our project, as soon as we get the repository. This means, creating a standard environment for development: Decide on specific technologies, setting up the environment, high level architecture of the system, etc.

* Division of labour for the next iteration: Assign specific tasks (maybe teams) to work on the skeleton of the project, with the use of Trello board. In other words, we want to assign responsibilities to maintain our Scrum task board on Trello.

* We should have a way to hold members accountable for what they promise to do. I.e. attend meetings they committed to beforehand and do the work they promised to get done. We decided to use Trello board and a Google document to keep track of member performance for the coming iterations. In case of some members being unreliable, we can try to talk to them to resolve any issues directly. In the worst case we will have other members do their work, and we will adjust participation marks accordingly.
