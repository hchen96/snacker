## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* When: October 10, 2018
* Where: In tutorial

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Individual thinking of ideas for project and voting. We decided that each one of our team should think about an idea, then explain it (i.e. write the idea, usability and impact of it, and possible problems that can arise), writing it out in a document. After that, we discussed them and voted to define our project. This decision made us think of different ideas and impacts of our products, and open our minds to different viewpoints.

* Creation of a group chat and a folder in Google Drive for our documents in this first iteration. Since in this first iteration we had to talk and discuss the scope and how our project would be implemented, this was a successful decision because it made it possible for us to discuss some urgent matters on the chat, and also collaborate on our documents more easily (since we didn't had our Github repo already).


* Writing an “ideas” file. Since it’s difficult for our group to meet up in person, we decided to create a file where we wrote down some features we thought of our own product (snack recommender). This helped a lot because people could argue in favor or against other features, and write possible solutions to problems others have found, all in the ideas doc.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Trying to set up meeting time outside of tut didn’t turn out so well. We can’t seem to find times that work for all of us, and whenever someone tries to initiate the physical meet up in the group chat, the group chat becomes dead...


* Two attempts at phone conference didn’t turn out well. For starters, there is absolutely no time that works for all members of the team so there are always 1 or 2 members who can’t attend the conference. Secondly, for people who could attend the phone conference, some of them weren’t showing up at the promised time due to various reasons. Lastly, communication through the phone turns out to be inefficient compared to each member just individually editing the documents in google drive and communicate through online messages for any confusion.
