#### Artifacts

We currently have a trello board for tasks. Each person is accountable for their own commitment. Since we are all on the same ship, if one person cannot reach their commitment we will re-prioritize their and others’ tasks for the next sprint. We will prioritize tasks that need to be released for the final product over bugs in production usually. Depending on the impact of the bug, we will prioritize that over new features. Tasks are assigned depending on the priority of the task and the “area” of the member, such as Backend, Frontend, etc.


We also have a google drive folder that stores all word type documents related to our project so members can edit them in real time. Since we didn't received our Github repo, we started on google drive.

## Product


#### Goals and tasks

Our goals for this iteration is to decide on which product we are going to build, what features our product is going to have, how our product is going to serve the users, what our product is going look like, and to make sure our team has the ability to develop our product.


List of task in order of priority: decide on the stack/framework/database -> setup everyone’s dev environment -> basic frontend -> decide on and set up database scheme -> create an account -> login -> search a snack -> create a snack -> read a snack -> review a snack -> verify a snack -> snack recommendation -> wishlist -> polish frontend.


For deliverable 2, we should go through the list and finish creating a snack, and our web app should at least be running locally with features such as create an account/login/search a snack/create a snack to show.


By deliverable 3, we should finish everything and our web app should be running publicly with all proposed functionalities working.
