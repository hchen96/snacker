#### Goals and tasks

List of task in order of priority: decide on the stack/framework/database -> setup everyone’s dev environment -> decide on the frontend look/choose a frontend template -> setup basic frontend -> decide on and set up database scheme -> create an account -> login -> populate database with some snacks -> search a snack -> user create a snack -> read a snack -> review a snack -> verify a snack -> snack recommendation -> wishlist -> polish everything

Our goals for this iteration is to decide on the stack and database schema and set up everyone’s dev environment. We also plan on finishing tasks up to and including “create a snack” in the above priority list. By the end of the second iteration, we should have at least a locally running website that support users to create acn account/login/search a snack/create a snack.

By deliverable 3, we should finish everything and our web app should be running publicly with all proposed functionalities working.

#### Artifacts

 * We should have a database schema graph to help others understand the relationships between our data
 * Video presenting the main idea of our web app
 * A draft website running locally that supports users to create account/login/search a snack/create a snack.
