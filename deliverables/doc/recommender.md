Recommender System dev - Snacker
========================
Do experiments in the file recommender_experiments.py.
Use a **local** database! For that, make sure you've downloaded mongodb,
and use this to save and restore databases:
- Save a database to a dump: [mongodump](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump)
- Restore a database from a dump: [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore)
